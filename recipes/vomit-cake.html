    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
     <li>Preheat your oven to 350F.</li>
     <li>Start out by placing the funnel into your mouth.</li>
     <li>Next you'll want to funnel in your flour.</li>
     <li>Try your hardest to swallow it <em>(The consumer will be able to taste your efforts.)</em></li>
     <li>You may drink water after swallowing.</li>
     <li>Then, funnel in your sugar and try to swallow.</li>
     <li>If the sugar doesn't dissolve quickly enough, you may drink water.</li> 
     <li>Drink the vanilla extract. <strong>Do not be alarmed by the taste.</strong></li>
     <li>Now chug your Vegetable Oil.</li>
     <li>You'll then want to take a hefty scoop of salt and consume it.</li>
     <li>Afterwards, take your 3 eggs, crack them, and whisk in seperate bowl.</li>
     <li>For this next step, you'll want to have your baking pan nearby.</li>
     <li>Once whisked, prepare your funnel and pour your eggs into your mouth.</li>
     <li>It is likely you will begin to vomit at this stage, that's normal! Make sure it goes into the baking pan.</li>
     <li>If you do not vomit, place your fingers at the back of your throat and trigger your gag reflexes until you do.</li>
     <li>You can drink your chocolate syrup for more flavor and to make the process more bearable.</li>
     <li>Vomit until the pan is at least halfway full to ensure all of your batter comes out.</li>
     <li>It tends to be watery at this stage, so add more flour until smooth consistency.</li>
     <li>Cook for 50 minutes, checking occasionally.</li>
     <li>Let it cool before decorating with frosting and sprinkles.</li>
     <li>Serve to your loved ones.</li>
    </ol>
